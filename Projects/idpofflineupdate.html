				<p>IDP offline update made easier
Despite IDP is not the ultimate security tool, yet it still being used around.

One of the main issues with IDP installed on security devices, not allowing the security device to have internet access to grep the database updates, leaving the IDP DB outdated.

If you are dealing with Juniper IDP, you’ll find the process of updating the DB is a real pain, getting some XML files & then extracting others.

Here’s a script that will make it easier to download and sort the DB files, and from there you can move the files to the security nodes.

Usage: 

python idpofflineupdate.py -u <username> -o <output folder location> -i <input file contains security nodes IPs or names>

Note: if you’re going to use the nodes’ names in the file make sure host file /DNS is used to map them to IPs.
